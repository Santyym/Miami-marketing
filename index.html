      <h2 class="center">​​The Benefits of Working with a Luxury Presence Agent</h2>
      <p class="yellow2">Why you should hire an agent who has partnered with a luxury real estate marketing company?
      </p>

      <p class="text-center center ">One of the biggest perks of working with a real estate agent is their
        ability to
        market your property to the
        right target audience. A professional agent with the right experience will be able to identify who will be
        interested in your property and implement effective strategies to reach them via their website, paid
        advertising,
        social media, and other means. When you work with an agent who has partnered with Luxury Presence, you benefit
        from the many different types ofmarketing capabilities the company offers. Here is how:</p>

    <div class="container-fluid">
      <h2 class="text-center padding">Paid Advertising on All Channels</h2>
      <p>To reach your potential buyers, you have to know who they are, where they spend their time online, and how they
        make
        their buying decisions. Agents who use luxury real estate marketing services are able to identify your niche
        market,
        then create paid ads on Facebook, Google, Instagram, and YouTube that reach those interested in your property.
        <br />
        <br />
        These
        paid ad campaigns are highly customized and targeted, ensuring you are not spending money marketing to those who
        are not
        in the market for a property such as yours.

      <div class=" white">
        <h2 class="text-center padding">Expert Content Production</h2>
        <p>Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property. Being able to
          create
          high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the agents who use
          luxury
          real
          estate marketing services above their competitors. According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and
          sellers
          want
          to work with an agent who uses video and for good reason.
          <br />
          <br />
          An agent who uses video is able to connect with
          potential
          buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are
          showing
          viewers what it would really be like to walk through and live in your home something that is much more
          difficult
          to do
          with a written description.
          However, written descriptionsor copywriting is also important. Your property needs to be described in
          appealing
          and
          vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to sell it.
          <br />
          <br />
          Those agents who work
          with
          Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content
          marketing
          pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.

      <h2 class="text-center">Effective Search Engine Optimization</h2>
      <p>Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on the internet. Many of them
        simply
        googled
        the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that way. For your home to show up in
        these
        types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the right terms in your online marketing.
        <br />
        <br />
        The effective
        use
        of
        these terms is referred to as search engine optimization or SEO.
        The process of identifying and correctly
        using
        the
        right terms is a bit of a science—one that the SEO experts at Luxury Presence have mastered. When a potential
        buyer
        searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide opportunities for
        the
        buyer
        to learn more.

      <div class="white">
        <h2 class="text-center">Social Media Marketing</h2>
        <p>If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands of niche buyers
          who
          are
          ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a large chunk of their
          time
          to
          social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate marketing service providers who can put in the
          work
          for
          them. Wouldn’t you rather your agent spent his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle
          their
          social
          media presence? At Luxury Presence, our dedicated success team utilizes an agent’s stories and feed posts to
          help
          them
          go viral and become an authority in their industry. Once they’ve harnessed the power of becoming an
          influencer,
          they can
          use their voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center">Immersive Property Experience</h2>
      <p>
        Every real estate agent’s success starts with their website. If an agent doesn’t have a responsive,
        user-friendly
        website that is easy to navigate and provides an immersive experience for viewers who want to look at
        properties,
        they’ve already lost their advantage. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence have websites that are designed
        and
        managed by seasoned professionals who know what property buyers want. Their sites are designed to impress with
        virtual
        tour integration, HD video capabilities, and lead capture strategies that help agents sell your home. Agents are
        further
        supported by analytics reporting, SEO optimization, third party integrations, and a reporting dashboard to help
        them
        easily utilize their site and maximize its potential. An agent who is backed by a powerful website is one who
        can
        easily
        reach a niche audience, streamline the selling process, and ensure your home gets the best promotion possible.
